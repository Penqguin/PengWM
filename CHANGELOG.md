## v0.5 — i3-style multi-monitor

One global workspace pool shared across all monitors, replacing the old
per-monitor clone sets.

- **Global workspaces:** one tree per `[[workspaces]]` name (5 by default,
  not 5×N). Each workspace lives on exactly one monitor; each monitor
  shows exactly one workspace.
- **Swap-on-switch:** `workspace-N` (now global 1-based config order) pulls
  a workspace shown on another monitor onto the focused one, swapping the
  displaced workspace back.
- **Display moves:** `focus-display-*` always lands (bookkeeping-only when
  empty); `move-window-to-display-*` always lands, bypassing `max_tiles`;
  focus stays on move. Default binds `alt-ctrl-arrows` /
  `alt-ctrl-shift-arrows`.
- **`monitor` affinity is now an initial-output hint.** App routing lands
  in the global name-tree with no auto-pull; overflow spills to the next
  global workspace with room. Old sessions auto-migrate (first-name-wins);
  orphans restore onto primary.
- **Bar:** still primary-only, now with per-output active markers.
- **`autostart`** runs once per workspace regardless of hint.

Upgraders: after updating, `workspace-N` means something global
(`2` = Browsing everywhere). Clear a stale topology with
`pengwm clear-session`.
